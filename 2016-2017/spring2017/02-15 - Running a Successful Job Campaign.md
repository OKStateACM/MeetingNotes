##### Succeeding at Career Fairs

* **GO!**
* Make an appointment with career service adviser -> best things you can do for your career
* what to do before the fair
  * check on the list of who is comming so you don't feel lost, or like no one wants to talk to you/you don't want to talk with anyone
  * brush up your resume
* what **not** to do while you are there
  * **don't** stand around and not talk to anyone, or walk around the fair aimlessly
  * **don't** forget to bring a *polished* resume
  * **don't** show up in jeans and a t-shirt
* what to do while you are there
  * **do** **network** - *engage in conversation with recruiters*, talk to anyone and everyone you can, even if it's not your 'dream job'
  * **do** bring several copies of your updated resume, preferably in a nice portfolio (*can buy them at career services in the student union, along with **free** resume paper!*)
  * **do** dress up nice - preferably *business professional* (guys - that means a suit and tie) though not strictly required, you will stand out if you dress otherwise. No matter what, **dress nicely**
  * **do** put on your best atitude - Confident and professional
  * **do** **take notes** - recruiters will tell you things like application dates, etc. *you need to write this down*
* **How to network**
  * walk up to a booth and *introduce yourself* **if nothing else, remember and do this step** (*also don't be afraid to stand in line to talk to a recruiter if they are busy*)
    * name, major, class year (junior/senior/etc)
    * "Hi, my name is ____ I'm a computer science student here at OSU. I'm a junior this year looking for an intership position this year" - you have stated *who* you are, *what* you are looking for/your purporse, and *when* you graduate
  * Ask a question and get the conversation going - **ask deep questions**
    * "Can you tell me a little about your company?"
    * "I saw you were looking for ____ for a ____ position on the hire site. Can you tell me more about what ____ does at your company?"
    * "Do you have any internship/fulltime positions available?" (*I would refrain from asking this unless you're really out of ideas - not a good first impression*)
  * And now you are having a conversation! The recruiter may ask you about yourself, your experiences, your classes, anything really.
    * use this time to talk about something. Don't just blurt out a quick sentence and call it done.
  * Ask more questions, (but don't be too annoying) **take notes on relavent information** -> makes it seem like you care, also so you can check back later for interviews, etc.
    * "What do you like best about your company?" (*would not recomend asking then what they like least at this point in the process*)
    * "What is the company culture like?"
    * "What sort of technology do you use?"
    * "Where are you located?"
    * "What sort of projects have past interns/employees worked on?"
    * "What would **I** be working on?" - (*often times they don't really know. I recomend the prevous question*)
  * If there are engineers/developers at the booth instead of just HR:
    * "What projects have **you** worked on? what was your favourite? why did you like it?"
  * Don't forget to ask about "administrative" questions like
    * "How do I apply?"
    * "Are there any deadlines?"
    * "What is your timetable? When can I expect a response?"
    * "**How does you're hiring process work?**" - things like, are there multiple interviews? group interviews? timelines? etc.
  * Be prepared to answer some basic things:
    * "what are you looking for in a job?" (*money, work/life balance, great coworkers, cool projects?*)
    * "what sort of programming languages/technologies have you used?" (*this is where it's nice if you can say something other than 'java/c++'*)
    * *be prepared to talk about things on your resume*
  * After the conversation has winded down, and you are ready to leave, or the recruiter is ready to talk with someone else, **if you have not done so, offer a copy of your resume**
  * **don't just awkwardly walk away** just like you would end a conversation with anyone else.
      * "Thank you for your time"
      * "It was nice talking to you"
      * "Thank you, I hope to hear from you soon"
      * "You've given me a lot of great information, I appreciate it"
