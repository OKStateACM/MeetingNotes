##### GPU - Graphics Card

- The Basics
  - Renders all you see on your computer.
  - Biggest bottleneck in desktop gaming.
  - A GPU's strength is measured by it's speed, it's cores, and it's memory
  
- The Advanced
  - Operates with it's own memory, called VRAM.
    - This allows the cards to operate smoothly.
    - Also makes sure card doesn't "steal" memory from the motherboard.
  - MANY MANY cores. Hundreds.
    - This makes the GPU very efficient at processing many math equations.
    - This means that the GPU does math. That's all it does.
    - Is usually given triangles to solve with colors to draw on the screen.
    - Can also be used to do intense calculations.
      - Bitcoin is mined on the GPU due to this capability.
  - The GPU's hardware makes it very efficient at floating-point math and matrices.

##### HDD/SSD - Hard Drive Disk/Solid State Drive
  
- The Basics
  - Stores data.
  - The memory is persistant without power.

- HDD/SSD What's the Difference?
  - HDD
    - A HDD is a set of metal disks.
      - They can have their magnetic information encoded with bytes.
    - Spins at very high speeds (3k to 10k RPM).
    - Very large amounts of data.
    - Pratically unlimited reads and writes.
    - Kinda slow, super cheap.
  - SSD
    - An SSD is like a large USB fash drive.
      - It utilizes flash memory, which is a flat, rectangular, and metal surface.
    - Limited in data.
    - Limited reads and writes (usually somewhere around 10k-50k).
    - Very fast, but a little more pricey.
- The Advanced
  - Diskettes are split into tracks, which are split into clusters, which are split into sectors.
  - Each disk has an MFT, or Master File Table.
    - MFT's store the physical index of each file.

##### RAM - Random Access Memory

- The Basics
  - Temporary memory storage.
  - This is where your programs store their large variables
  
- The Advanced
  - Unlike HDDs, RAM stores memory with flip-flops, so it resets when power is disconencted.
  - When the RAM fills up, the computer begins storing data in the HDD.
    - This is much slower than reading and writing from RAM.
  - You may have heard of DDR2 and DDR3 and DDR4 memory.
    - These are different architecture of memory.
    - DDR4 is the newest, and is very fast.
