##### Rules of Working With Hardware

- Avoid banging things around.

- Set down components on soft surfaces.

- Most importantly, *STAY GROUNDED*
  - Static electricity can ruin computer parts.

##### GPU
  
- The GPU is responsible for the quality of the image you see in games.

- Typically the biggest bottleneck in gaming.

- It also does the bulk of the work when you are rendering models.

- Manages the math behind computer graphics.
  - Hardware inside specializes in matrix algebra and floating-point math.

- We interface this complex math with API's like OpenGL and DirectX3D

- Less impact on gaming, but still affects it.

- Usual rig will run one SSD and one HDD

##### CPU

- The heart of your computer.

- Biggest bottleneck for general computer speed.

- Runs in cycles.

- Millions of transistors.

Intel:
