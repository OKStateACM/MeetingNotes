##### Rules of Working With Hardware

- Avoid banging things around.

- Set down components on soft surfaces.

- Most importantly, *STAY GROUNDED*
  - Static electricity can ruin computer parts, and hence, your wallet.

##### GPU
  
- The GPU is responsible for the quality of the image you see in games.

- Typically the biggest bottleneck in gaming.

- It also does the bulk of the work when you are rendering models.

- Manages the math behind computer graphics.
  - Hardware inside specializes in matrix algebra and floating-point math. And magic.

- We interface this complex math with API's like OpenGL and DirectX3D

##### HDD/SSD

- Stores long term data on your machine.

- Has a **HUGE** effect on load times as well as boot times.

- Less impact on gaming, but still affects it.
  - Faster drives makes faster startup times for games.
  - Faster load times for map segments as well.

- Usual rig will run one SSD and one HDD.

##### RAM

- Stores short term data on your machine.

- Biggest bottleneck for multitasking.
  - Also bottlenecks everything else.

- Volatile, resets when power is lost.

- Has a large affect on game performance.

- DDR
  - Double Data Rate.
  - 64 bit interface.
  - Higher number after DDR = faster, larger, better, more expensive. Each is a different architecture.

Ram vs Cache

##### CPU

- The heart of your computer. All data transfers through the CPU.

- Manages math, logic, direction, and more.

- Biggest bottleneck for general computer speed.

- Runs in cycles.
  - Toggling of current.
  - Change of state per cycle.
  - One instruction takes multiple cycles.

- Billions of transistors.

Intel:
- Pros
  - Higher max performance.
  - Cooler.
  - Works better when paired with a GPU.
- Cons
  - Much more expensive.
  
AMD:
- Pros
  - Cheap!
  - More cores.
  - APU's built for mobile and laptops.
  - Ryzen is kickass! More on that below....
- Cons
  - Lower max performance.
  - Hotter.
  
###### Some Benchmarks

##### MOBO

- The Motherboard connects everything together.

- **The motherboard must match your processor**
  - Each motherboard is made to hold a certain chip type.
  - Motherboards can only support one chip type.

- Determines RAM type.

- Contrary to the fatherboard, actually takes care of your pc parts.

##### PSU

- Supplies power to the computer.

- Last part you pick. Must be enough to accommodate for each piece.

- Modular allows for better cable management.
