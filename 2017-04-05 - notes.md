##### Rules of Working With Hardware

- Avoid banging things around.

- Set down components on soft surfaces.

- Most importantly, *STAY GROUNDED*
  - Static electricity can ruin computer parts.

##### GPU

- Manages the math behind computer graphics.
  - Hardware inside specializes in matrix algebra and floating-point math.
  
- The GPU is responsible for the quality of image you see in games.

- It also does a bulk of the work when you are rendering models.

- We interface this with API's like OpenGL and DirectX3D
