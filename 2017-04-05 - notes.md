##### GPU - Graphics Card

- The Basics
  - Renders all you see on your computer.
  - Largest bottleneck in desktop gaming.
  - A GPU's strength is measured by it's speed, it's cores, and it's memory
  
- The Advanced
  - Operates with it's own memory, called VRAM.
    - This allows the cards to operate smoothly.
    - Also makes sure card doesn't "steal" memory from the motherboard.
  - MANY MANY cores. Hundreds.
    - This makes the GPU very efficient at processing many math equations.
    - This means that the GPU does math. That's all it does.
    - Is usually given triangles to solve with colors to draw on the screen.
    - Can also be used to do intense calculations.
      - Bitcoin is mined on the GPU due to this capability.
  - The GPU's hardware makes it very efficient at floating-point math and matrices.

##### HDD/SSD - Hard Drive Disk/Solid State Drive
  
- The Basics
  - Stores data.
  - The memory is persistant without power.

- HDD/SSD What's the Difference?
  - HDD
    - A HDD is a set of metal disks.
      - They can have their magnetic information encoded with bytes.
    - Spins at very high speeds (3k to 10k RPM).
    - Very large amounts of data.
    - Pratically unlimited reads and writes.
    - Kinda slow, super cheap.
  - SSD
    - An SSD is like a large USB fash drive.
      - It utilizes flash memory, which is a flat, rectangular, and metal surface.
    - Limited in data.
    - Limited reads and writes (usually somewhere around 10k-50k).
    - Very fast, but a little more pricey.
- The Advanced
  - Diskettes are split into tracks, which are split into clusters, which are split into sectors.
  - Each disk has an MFT, or Master File Table.
    - MFT's store the physical index of each file.

##### RAM - Random Access Memory

- The Basics
  - Temporary memory storage.
  - This is where your programs store their large variables
  - Largest bottleneck in multitasking
  
- The Advanced
  - Unlike HDDs, RAM stores memory with flip-flops, so it resets when power is disconencted.
  - When the RAM fills up, the computer begins storing data in the HDD.
    - This is much slower than reading and writing from RAM.
  - You may have heard of DDR2 and DDR3 and DDR4 memory.
    - These are different architecture of memory.
    - DDR4 is the newest, and is very fast.

##### CPU - Central Processing Unit

- The Basics
  - Does all of the work of the computer.
  - Determines the overall speed of the computer.
  
- INTEL VS AMD
  - Quite possibly the largest competition in the hardware industry.
  - Intel
    - Processors excell at multicore functionality.
    - Very good for your common user and businesses as it is made for multitasking.
    - Very expensive
  - AMD
    - Processors have amazing single core performance.
      - Due to games not being optimized for multicore, this is a plus.
    - Still very expensive, but much cheaper than equivilent Intel chips.
    
- The Advanced
  - Operates via transistors.
    - Transistor is a 3 way junction to choose the input.
  - Contains a cache.
    - Cache is like a smaller RAM that is stored on top of the CPU for fast fetch times.
  - Contains an ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit
    - The ALU uses integrated circuts to determine the outcome of arithmetic.
  - Runs in "cycles".
    - How fast the current runs through the processor.
    - Typically 1GHz to 6GHz, but can be more.
    - Each cycle completes one instruction.

##### MOBO - Motherboard

- The Basics
  - Holds the entire computer together!
  - Supplies connections for every unit.
  
- The Advanced
  - Takes power in and gives it to each unit.
  - Usually contains many of the less important components.
    - Sound processor.
    - Network processor.
    - BIOS.

##### PSU - Power Supply Unit

- The Basics
  - The lungs of the computer.
  - Supplies power to the MOBO and other pieces.

- The Advanced
  - Usually contains surge protector.
  - Operates with capacitors to store residual power.
  - Heaviest part of a computer.
