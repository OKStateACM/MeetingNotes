        - "OSU CEAT Career Fair 2017" app for iPhone or Android

    - Start by going through and finding a few companies that you are interested in.

    - Go to each company's website and prepare a couple questions for each, such as:

        - "What skills do you look for most in a candidate for *X* position?"

            - By going to their website, you can find the specific positions that they are hiring for. By already having an idea what the company wants out of the hiree, it makes it easier to show you are a good fit for the position.

        - "What do you think about *X*?"

            - After doing a little research of the company and their recent ventures, you can bring up a recent (positive) trend by the company. A lot of people enjoy talking about what they do and this will show the recruiter that you have some knowledge of the company.

- What to bring

    - Prepare a folder with some printed off resumes. Don’t only print off enough for your preferred companies.

    - A pen and notepad to jot down any info the recruiter gives you, such as: phone number, application tips, or even a place/time to interview.

    - A bag to hold any handouts from recruiters.

    - A nice smile and a firm handshake.
