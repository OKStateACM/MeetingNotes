##### Introduction to Git

###### Setup

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

- Install Git

    - __Windows__: Install Git from [git-scm.com/download](https://www.git-scm.com/download). Make sure the installer also installs Git Bash.
    - __Linux__: Install the `git` package using your package manager of choice.
    - __Mac__: No worries - Git should already be installed!

###### What is Git?

Git is a tool for *version control* – maintaining the history of changes made to a file or directory.

###### Version Control Exercise

> "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."

1. Using pen and paper, copy down the above sentence.

2. Rewrite the above sentence, making a single change. This change can be adding a word, removing a word, or replacing a word.

3. Get with a couple of other people who have done the above two steps. Merge your changes together into one sentence.

4. Everyone in the group should copy this new sentence, and then make another change.

5. Merge everyone's changes together once more.

###### Reflecting on the Version Control Exercise

- What problems did you encounter? Did two people change the same word? Did one person replace a word that another simply removed? How did you resolve those conflicts?

Alex's branch is merged into Ben's branch, which is then merged into the master.](http://i.imgur.com/vP4ryBu.png)

###### Repositories

- **Repositories** (*repos* for short) -- a folder with Git superpowers enabled. This means it will track changes made to tracked files inside that directory.

###### Git Workflow and Commands

![Git workflow](http://i.imgur.com/v9ItIzc.png)

- Open up your terminal with Git installed. For Mac and Linux users, this should be your regular terminal. Windows users should open Git Bash.

- Configuring Git (for first-time use)

    - `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`

    - `git config --global user.email "john.doe@okstate.edu"`

- Two ways to create a Git repository

    1. Turn a preexisting directory into a repository:

        - Navigate inside the folder you'd like to turn into a repository using the `cd` command ([refresher/introduction to `cd`](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Step_by_Step_Guide/s1-navigating-cd.html)).

        - When inside the folder you'd like to turn into a repository, call `git init` – this turns your folder into a repo.

    2. Create a new directory and initialize it as repository instantly: `git init myNewRepo`

- `git status` to check where you are in the Git workflow and to see which problems need to be corrected. Call it often.

- Staging and committing

    - **Objective:** Git doesn't store every change made to a file ever. Instead, it stores snapshots, called *commits*, of a file on command. We want to get to this point.

    - *Modify working directory:* This is where we make the relevant changes to our codebase.

        - The working directory is the stuff *we* see and change when we add files, remove them, or modify them.

    - *Add changes to staging area:* This is to queue up files that have been modified since the last commit to have their changes saved in the next commit. To add `file.txt`'s changes to the staging area, call `git add file.txt`

        - Useful shortcut: `git add .` will add all modified files to the staging area

    - *Commit changes:* To actually commit all changes that are queued up in the staging area, call `git commit -m "[Insert commit message here]"`

        - All commits must have a *commit message* attached. This should serve as a useful description of the changes made.

        - It's a good practice to commit every time you've added a working feature.

- Branching

    ![A branch diagram of the above exercise, demonstrating two branches created from the master. Ben's branch, in orange, changes "brown" to "green." Alex's branch, in blue, changes "fox" to "frog." Alex's branch is merged into Ben's branch, which is then merged into the master.](http://i.imgur.com/vP4ryBu.png)

    - In an enterprise-scale application, the *master branch* is usually what gets shipped out to clients or users.

        - It's a really bad idea to make changes directly to the master branch, because one developer's changes could make the code refuse to compile or break other developers' code. Because of this, it's a best practice to open a new branch to build a new feature in.

    - Branches provide an alternate version of the codebase to make changes in without messing up the original.

    - Branching workflow

        - *Create the branch:* Create a branch named `examplebranch` with `git branch examplebranch`

            - Run a `git status` call. Note that it tells you you're still on `master`.

                - You can also call `git branch` to see which branch you're on, as well as a list of all the branches in the repository.

        - *Switch branches:* To switch to `examplebranch`, call `git checkout examplebranch`

            - Useful shortcut: If you want to create a new branch and instantly switch to it, call `git checkout -b examplebranch`

        - *Modify branch:* Make changes to the branch's codebase, add, commit, and so forth.

            - You can see for yourself that these changes are not affecting `master` by switching to `master` (`git checkout master`) and noticing that your changes aren't there.

        - *Merge branches:* When you're satisfied with the changes you've made, you probably want to merge those changes into another branch (namely `master` or, in many workplaces, `development`).

            - *Make sure your changes have been committed*

            - *Switch to the branch that you want to accept the changes:* This will usually be `git checkout master` (or, in many workplaces, `git checkout development`).

            - *Call `git merge examplebranch`*: This will take the changes from `examplebranch` and copy them into `master`.

                - `examplebranch` remains unchaged.

                - *Resolve merge conflicts:* Merging isn't always a straightforward process. If the branch you're merging changes into has had a few commits of its own, you might have *merge conflicts* -- instances where the same code has been modified in different ways and those changes cannot be reconciled automatically.

##### Remote Repositories and GitHub

- *Local repository:* a repository which exists on one person's machine

- *Remote repository:* a repository hosted on some server

    - Necessary to use Git collaboratively

    - [GitHub](https://www.github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and others

###### Creating a *fresh* repository on GitHub

1. After logging in to your GitHub account, click the green "New repository" button on the right.

2. Give this repository a name and, because we __aren't__ uploading any preexisting repositories, __click__ the checkbox to initialize this GitHub repository with a README. Click the "Create repository" button.

3. You can use GitHub's online interface to make changes, but you'll probably prefer to make changes locally. To create a local version of the repository to make changes to, you'll need to *clone* the repository. Navigate into your repository on GitHub, and click the green "Clone or download" button. Copy that link that starts with `git@github.com:` and ends with `.git`.

4. In your Bash terminal, navigate to the folder where you'd like to keep your local version of the repository and call the `git clone "git@github.com:YourGitHubUsername/yourGitHubRepo.git"` command, substituting the link in quotes with the repository link you just copied.

###### Getting a Preexisting Repository onto GitHub

1. After logging in to your GitHub account, click the green "New repository" button on the right.

2. Give this repository a name and, because we __are__ uploading any preexisting repositories, leave the checkbox to initialize this GitHub repository with a README __unchecked__. Click the "Create repository" button.

3. On the next page, copy the link that starts with `git@github.com:` and ends with `.git`.

4. Navigate into your repository in Bash and call the `git remote add origin "git@github.com:YourGitHubUsername/yourGitHubRepo.git"` command, substituting the link in quotes with the repository link you just copied. This connects your local repository to the repository hosted on GitHub.

5. *Push* your preexisting files (which should already have been committed) to GitHub by calling `git push origin master` – this sends any commits that have been made locally to the `origin` server, `master` branch.

###### Pushing and Pulling

![Two monkeys are shown with local versions of a remote repository. They both say "I edit this!" in reference to their own local repository. Both local repositories have an arrow labeled "Push" directed to the remote repository and an arrow labeled "Pull" directed from the remote repository. ](https://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/img/post/intro/capture_intro1_2_2.png)

Now that you have a local version of a remote repository, it's time to make some changes! Modify a file in your local repository. Then add it to the stage area and then commit it. For the time being, this commit only stays in the local repository. If we visit the repo on GitHub, we wouldn't see any changes. To push our local commits to the remote repository, `git push origin master` in the local repository.

- To push to someone else's GitHub repository, we need to be a member of their repo. Have them visit their repo on GitHub, click "Settings," then go to "Collaborators." Then have them add your GitHub username. You'll receive an email that you'll have to accept.

Our local repository is not automatically updated whenever changes are made to the remote repository. To update our local repository with changes to the remote repo, call the `git pull` command.
