## What is a technical interview

  - More advanced than a behavioural interview
  
  - Interviewer asks technological questions
  
  - Usually involves white boarding or psuedocode (more on that below)
  
## Why are they used

  - Weed out less technical applicants
  
  - See if you have the skills you claim you do
  
  - See if you meet the qualifications for the position
  
## White boarding

  - Putting you on the spot
  
  - Write a program, on a whiteboard
  
  - Tips
  
    - Remember, no one's perfect
    
    - It doesn't have to be syntactically perfect, but it may matter
    
    - Talk through it with your interviewer
    
    - Squeeze as much info as you can out of your interviewer

## Some tips to remember in Technical Interviews

  - Use a language you're familiar with

  - Hashmaps and dictionaries are a godsend
  
    - Constant (O(1)) lookup, addition, and removal
    
    - Very scaleable
    
  - Always do brute force first unless you know how to do a faster solution beforehand
  
  - Ask questions!
  
    - How much would this be used in a real world application? (How scaleable does it need to be)
    
    - Is there an estimate for how large N will be? (How big is your dataset)
    
    - What kind of hardware will this be running on? (How much power do you have)
    
  - Make sure you have questions after your interview

    - This is an oppurtinity to show your interest in the company
    
    - Recent events (S3 shutdown)
    
    - Big changes in the tech world (Self driving trucks)
    
    - Professional growth (Promotional ladder)
