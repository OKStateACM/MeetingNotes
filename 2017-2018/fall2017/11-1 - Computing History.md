# History of Computing

## <strong>Why should you care about the history of computing?</strong>

Computers are a really really cool thing to learn about. I know it probably seems more interesting/practical to learn how to advance computing, rather than learn the history of it. Learning from history is one of the best ways to prepare yourself for the future! 

## Computer? I hardly know her!

The computer was created out of a need to solve practical issues in the world as population size grew exponentially. By 1880, the US population was so large that is was taking around 7 years to calculate the census results.
 In order to expedite this process, the US government created punch card machines that took up entire rooms to help compute this data. Although 1880 seems ancient to us now, that is not even close to the first computer. 


## Ancient Times
* Abacus
  * The abacus was created in 2400 B.C. because the scale of society had become greater than what a single person could keep and      manipulate in their minds. 
  * The abacus was able to not only simply calculate equations, it was able to also store the current state of the computation. This  early form of a calculator was used for thousands of years.
  * [Cool little example](http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~thormae/lectures/ti1/code/abacus/sanpan.html)
  
  
 * Binary Numeral System
   * Created by Pingala in 500 B.C.
   * The use of 1 as positive and 0 as negative is often what is assumed when your hear about binary. Pingala actually used light (laghu) and heavy (guru) in place of 1 and 0.
   * Pingala’s writings also included early representations of Pascal’s Triangle and Fibonacci Numbers.
   
   
* Heron of Alexandria
   * Heron of Alexandria was a mathematician and engineer from Alexandria, Roman Egypt. Heron of Alexandria invented machines that are able to follow a series of instructions.
   * Heron of Alexandria created the first vending machine. When a coin was entered into a slot on the top of the machine, a set amount of holy water was dispensed.
   * Heron of Alexandria created the first instance in history of wind operating an instrument in his design of a windwheel operating an organ. He also made the first designed for a syringe to control the delivery of air and liquids.

## A while back but not too long of a while back but still a long time.

* Jacquard Loom
    * The Jacquard Loom is a device fitted to a power loom that simplifies the process of the manufacturing of textiles with super complex patterns like [brocade](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Paris_-_Cath%C3%A9drale_Notre-Dame_-_Tr%C3%A9sor_de_la_cath%C3%A9drale_-_Ornements_sacerdotaux_-3.JPG/800px-Paris_-_Cath%C3%A9drale_Notre-Dame_-_Tr%C3%A9sor_de_la_cath%C3%A9drale_-_Ornements_sacerdotaux_-3.JPG), [damask](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/ItalianSilkDamask.jpg/220px-ItalianSilkDamask.jpg), and [matelasse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Woven_Fabric_%28ST509%29_-_Woven_Fabric_-_MoMu_Antwerp.jpg/220px-Woven_Fabric_%28ST509%29_-_Woven_Fabric_-_MoMu_Antwerp.jpg).
    * The device was created by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804. 
    * The Jacquard head used replaceable punch cards to control the machine’s operations. It is considered an important step in computer hardware history. The machine was able to change the pattern of the loom’s weave based on which card was in it. 
    * This was a huge conceptual step in the development of computer programming.

  * Hollerith’s Punch Card Machine
    * In 1890, Herman Hollerith created a mechanism using electrical connections to increment a counter and record the information.
    * The idea of the Punch Card machine was that data could be recorded by the presence or absence of a hole on a punch card.
    * For example, in the hole section that specifies marital status, a hole would mean married and no hole would mean single.
    * This punch card system was able to complete the 1980 Census in just 3 years and saving the government millions. 
    * Hollerith then went on to found what would become IBM.
    
  * Turing Machine
    * The Turing Machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing.
    * The Turing Machine was the notion of a universal machine capable of computing anything that is computable.
    * The central concept of the modern computer was based off this.
    * Turing Completeness is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine.
    * A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers; nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.
    
    
## A while back but your grandparents were alive so not that long
  * Cobol/Fortran
    * In 1953, Grace Hopper created the first programming language, that would eventually be called Cobol.
    * In 1954, John Backus led a team of programmers at IBM and created the programming language FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation).
    * These languages cut the time needed to program 20-fold and the need of exact and efficient code led to the evolution of the design and theory behind compiler technology.
    
  * Modern Computer?
    * In 1964, Douglas Engelbart showed the prototype for the first modern computer. It included a mouse and a GUI.
    * This was the first step to the current computing lifestyle; the start of computers not being a tool specifically made for scientists, but a tool that is accessible to the general public.
    In 1971, Alan Shugart led a team of IBM engineers and invented the “floppy disk”, this allowed information to be shared with others.
In 1973, Robert Metcalfe, a member of a Xerox research team, invented Ethernet. This allowed computers to be connected to each other and other hardware.  


  * Personal Computers
    * From 1974-1977, a few personal computers hit the market: IBM 5100, Radio Shack’s TRS-80, Scelbi & Mark-8 Altair.
    * The TRS-80 sold like crazy, which was unexpected. There were only 3000 made in its first production run. Normies were able to use and control computers for the first time.
  * Apple
    * In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started Apple Computers on April Fools Day and release the Apple I. This was the first computer with a single-circuit board.
    * In 1977, Jobs and Wozniak showcase the Apple II. The Apple II was full of new features like color graphics and an audio cassette drive for storage.
    * In 1983, Apple releases Lisa. Lisa was the first personal computer with a GUI. Lisa flopped, but she would evolve into the Macintosh.
    * In 1984, Apple released [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA) SuperBowl commercial. This commercial was based on the novel by George Orwell "1984". 
   * A new challenger approaches
      * In 1985, as a response to Apple's GUI, Microsoft announced Windows.

## Millennials will remember some of this stuff

  * In 1998, the greatest thing to hit the Computer Science realm - no, the world - is birthed.
  * In 2001, Apple unveils the Mac OS X operating system, which provides protected memory architecture and pre-emptive multi-tasking, among other benefits. 
  * At the same time, Microsoft rolls out Windows XP, which has a significantly redesigned GUI.
  * In 2004, Mozilla Firefox 1.0 is released. This is the first real competitor to Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
  * In 2005, YouTube, a video sharing service, is founded. Google acquires Android, a Linux-based mobile phone operating system.
  * In 2006, Apple introduces the MacBook Pro, its first Intel-based, dual-core mobile computer, as well as an Intel-based iMac. Nintendo's Wii game console hits the market.
  * In 2009, Microsoft peaked at Windows 7, which offers the ability to pin applications to the taskbar and advances in touch and handwriting recognition, among other features.
  * In 2017, Ethan Mayberry made a dandy Twitch.tv chatbot.
