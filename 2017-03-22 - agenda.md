##### A Brief Introduction to Ruby and Ruby on Rails

- **Ruby** is a programming language designed to be fairly intuitive and very readable for humans.

    - "Hello World!" in Java:
    ```java
    public class Hello
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }
    ```

    - "Hello World!" in Ruby:
    ```ruby
    puts "Hello World!"
    ```

- **Rails** is a *framework* for Ruby to make back-end web development -- applications running on servers -- far easier.

    - Rails has three core tenets for development:

        1. *Don't Repeat Yourself* - [By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

        2. *Convention over Configuration* - [Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

        3. *Model-View-Controller Architecture*  - the internal states of the program (**model**), the program display (**view**), and the program interface (**controller**) should have an enforced separation between them

- Ruby is open-source and enjoys enthusiastic support from a large community.

    - This means solutions to almost any problem you may have can be found online.

    - It also means a wide variety of **gems** - the Ruby equivalent of packages - can be found to fit your needs.

##### Introduction to Programming in Ruby

- Ruby is a high-level, object-oriented programming language.

- Ruby's variables, [much like JavaScript's](https://github.com/OKStateACM/meetingnotes/blob/master/2017-02-22%20-%20agenda.md), are dynamically-typed. Creating variables is easy.
    ```ruby
    foo = 20
    bar = "Hello World"
    ```

- Ruby doesn't use braces for codeblocks like Java or C, and nor is it whitespace-sensitive like Python. Rather, codeblocks start with a line like a method header or an `if` statement and end with an `end` statement.
    ```ruby
    # if statements
    if user_num < 0
        puts "You picked a negative integer!"
        puts "Why would you do that?"
    elsif user_num > 0
        puts "You picked a positive integer!"
        puts "Congrats!"
    else
        puts "You picked zero!"
        puts "ಠ_ಠ"
    end
    ```

- To create a method called `my_method` in Ruby, you would use the following code.
    ```ruby
    def my_first_method
        # Ruby code goes here
    end
    ```

    - Alternatively, if you need parameters like `name` and `age`...
        ```ruby
        def my_second_method(name, age)
            # Ruby code goes here
        end
        ```

    - Calling your method works familiarly. Call `my_second_method()` with the following code:
        ```ruby
        my_second_method("Pistol Pete", 21)
        ```

        - If, as in `my_first_method()`, you don't have any parameters, parentheses are optional:
            ```ruby
            my_first_method
            # ... works the same as ...
            my_first_method()
            ```

- As Ruby is object-oriented, you can create classes:
    ```ruby
    class Student
        # class variables -- think of Java's static variables -- are denoted by "@@"
        @@species = "human"

        # initialize() is Student's constructor
        def initialize(name, school, gpa)
            # the "@" makes these variables *instance variables*...
            # ...they'll be accessible to all methods of the instance of this class
            @name = name
            @school = school
            @gpa = gpa
        end

        def graduate
            # Ruby code goes here
        end

        def flunk
            # Ruby code goes here
        end
    end
    ```

    - You can now construct an instance of `Student` like so:
        ```ruby
        pistol_pete = Student.new("Pistol Pete", "Oklahoma State University", 4.0)
        ```

- Finally, everything in Ruby is an object... even data literals.

    - You can get the length of a string literal, for instance, by calling
        ```ruby
        "Hello".length
        ```

    - This is also exploited in a kind of for-loop present in Ruby: `.times`:
        ```ruby
        # The following code prints "Hello!" five times
        5.times do
            puts "Hello!"
        end
        ```

        - Ruby does have other loops, but they're fairly standard and easy to research.

##### Creating Your First Rails Application

- Create a brand new folder for your application and name it `rubytut`.

- In your newly Ruby-enabled terminal (for Windows users, this will be a new Command Prompt program called `Command Prompt with Ruby and Rails`), navigate into your `rubytut` folder.

- Inside `rubytut`, we'll create our first Rails app, called `hello_app`, using the command `rails new hello_app`. This will likely take a bit.

    - If we had wanted to create a Rails app using a specific version of Rails, like 5.0.1 for instance, we could have used `rails _5.0.1_ new hello_app`.

    - If you're getting a "The system cannot find the path specified" error, [here's the fix](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35730896).

- Rails has now created a whole directory for `hello_app`.
```
'---hello_app
    |---app                         # Core app components
    |   |---assets
    |   |   |---config
    |   |   |---images
    |   |   |---javascripts
    |   |   |   '---channels
    |   |   '---stylesheets
    |   |---channels
    |   |   '---application_cable
    |   |---controllers
    |   |   '---concerns
    |   |---helpers
    |   |---jobs
    |   |---mailers
    |   |---models
    |   |   '---concerns
    |   '---views
    |       '---layouts
    |---bin                         # Binary executables
    |---config                      # App configuration
    |   |---environments
    |   |---initializers
    |   '---locales
    |---db                          # Database files
    |---lib                         # Non-vendor libraries
    |   |---assets
    |   '---tasks
    |---log                         # App log files
    |---public                      # Files accessible to public
    |---test                        # App tests
    |   |---controllers
    |   |---fixtures
    |   |   '---files
    |   |---helpers
    |   |---integration
    |   |---mailers
    |   '---models
    |---tmp                         # Temporary files
    |   '---cache
    |       '---assets
    |---vendor                      # Third-party code such as plugins and gems
        '---assets
            |---javascripts
            '---stylesheets
    |---.gitignore
    |---config.ru
    |---Gemfile                     # App's gem dependencies
    |---Gemfile.lock                # Specific versions of dependencies used
    |---Rakefile
    '---README.md
```

- Rails also makes it really easy to host a Rails server locally to run our application. While inside your `hello_app` directory, call the `rails server` command.

    - Your server should now be running at `localhost:3000` (3000 is the default port for Rails applications). You can navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see your application's default landing page.
