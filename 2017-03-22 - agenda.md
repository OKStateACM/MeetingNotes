##### A Brief Introduction to Ruby and Ruby on Rails

- **Ruby** is a programming language designed to be fairly intuitive and very readable for humans.

    - "Hello World!" in Java:
    ```java
    public class Hello
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }
    ```

    - "Hello World!" in Ruby:
    ```ruby
    puts "Hello World!"
    ```

- **Rails** is a *framework* for Ruby to make back-end web development -- applications running on servers -- far easier.

    - Rails has three core tenets for development:

        1. *Don't Repeat Yourself* - [By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

        2. *Convention over Configuration* - [Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

        3. *Model-View-Controller Architecture*  - the internal states of the program (**model**), the program display (**view**), and the program interface (**controller**) should have an enforced separation between them

- Ruby is open-source and enjoys enthusiastic support from a large community.

    - This means solutions to almost any problem you may have can be found online.

    - It also means a wide variety of **gems** - the Ruby equivalent of packages - can be found to fit your needs.

##### Creating Your First Rails Application

- Create a brand new folder for your application and name it `rubytut`.

- In your newly Ruby-enabled terminal (for Windows users, this will be a new Command Prompt program called `Command Prompt with Ruby and Rails`), navigate into your `rubytut` folder.

- Inside `rubytut`, we'll create our first Rails app, called `hello_app`, using the command `rails new hello_app`. This will likely take a bit.

    - If we had wanted to create a Rails app using a specific version of Rails, like 5.0.1 for instance, we could have used `rails _5.0.1_ new hello_app`.

    - If you're getting a "The system cannot find the path specified" error, [here's the fix](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35730896).

- Rails has now created a whole directory for `hello_app`.
```
'---hello_app
    |---app                         # Core app components
    |   |---assets
    |   |   |---config
    |   |   |---images
    |   |   |---javascripts

    |   '---views
    |       '---layouts
    |---bin                         # Binary executables
    |---config                      # App configuration

    |   |---initializers
    |   '---locales

    |---lib                         # Non-vendor libraries
    |   |---assets
    |   '---tasks
    |---log                         # App log files
    |---public                      # Files accessible to public
    |---test                        # App tests
    |   |---controllers
    |   |---fixtures
    |   |   '---files
    |   |---helpers
    |   |---integration
    |   |---mailers
    |   '---models
    |---tmp                         # Temporary files
    |   '---cache
    |       '---assets
    |---vendor                      # Third-party code such as plugins and gems
        '---assets
            |---javascripts
            '---stylesheets
    |---.gitignore
    |---config.ru
    |---Gemfile                     # App's gem dependencies
    |---Gemfile.lock                # Specific versions of dependencies used
    |---Rakefile
    '---README.md
```

- Rails also makes it really easy to host a Rails server locally to run our application. While inside your `hello_app` directory, call the `rails server` command.

    - Your server should now be running at `localhost:3000` (3000 is the default port for Rails applications). You can navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see your application's default landing page.
