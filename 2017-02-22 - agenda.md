##### A Brief Introduction

- [Previously](https://github.com/OKStateACM/meetingnotes/blob/master/2017-02-01%20-%20agenda.md), we've discussed HTML and CSS – tools for manipulating the structure and look of webpages. However, using HTML and CSS alone will only give you *static* webpages. *Dynamic* webpages require some amount of programming, using tools such as JavaScript and jQuery.

    - Three layers of web design:

        - **Content Layer** – HTML

        - **Presentation Layer** – CSS

        - **Behavior Layer** – JavaScript

- *JavaScript* is a programming language that runs *client-side*, meaning it's executed in the browser of anyone viewing your webpage.

- *jQuery* is a *[framework](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/)* for JavaScript that abstracts away a lot of the minutia of web development.

##### JavaScript

- There are two ways to get JavaScript code to work in an HTML document

    1. Using `<script>` tags. Anything between the opening `<script>` tag and the closing `</script>` tag is interpreted as JavaScript code rather than displayed to the user.

    ```html
    <script>
        // JavaScript code goes here
    </script>
    ```

    2. Linking to a JavaScript file. For instance, if you have a JavaScript file called `myScript.js`, you could import it using
    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="myScript.js"></script>
    ```
    The `src` attribute contains the absolute or relative reference to the script.
