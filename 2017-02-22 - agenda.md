##### A Brief Introduction

- [Previously](https://github.com/OKStateACM/meetingnotes/blob/master/2017-02-01%20-%20agenda.md), we've discussed HTML and CSS – tools for manipulating the structure and look of webpages. However, using HTML and CSS alone will only give you *static* webpages. *Dynamic* webpages require some amount of programming, using tools such as JavaScript and jQuery.

    - Three layers of web design:

        - **Content Layer** – HTML

        - **Presentation Layer** – CSS

        - **Behavior Layer** – JavaScript

- *JavaScript* is a programming language that runs *client-side*, meaning it's executed in the browser of anyone viewing your webpage.

    - JavaScript stands out from other languages you might have experienced in that it's very *event-driven*. There's a huge focus on things happening in response to other things, and your code is guaranteed to operate in the linear order you write it in.

- *jQuery* is a *[framework](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/)* for JavaScript that abstracts away a lot of the minutia of web development. JavaScript is kind of infamous for having many, many frameworks out there that do different things.

##### JavaScript – The Theory

- There are two ways to get JavaScript code to work in an HTML document

    - Using `<script>` tags. Anything between the opening `<script>` tag and the closing `</script>` tag is interpreted as JavaScript code rather than displayed to the user.
    ```html
    <script>
        // JavaScript code goes here
    </script>
    ```

    - Linking to a JavaScript file. For instance, if you have a JavaScript file called `myScript.js`, you could import it using
    ```html
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>
    ```
    The `src` attribute contains the absolute or relative reference to the script. Linking to a JavaScript file is a good practice because it promotes code reuse and leaves the HTML file much less cluttered.

- One of the biggest differences between writing JavaScript code and code from other languages such as, say, Java is how JavaScript handles *typing*. Whereas languages like Java may have explicit variable types such as `int`, `float`, `boolean`, or `String`, JavaScript's variables are all simply `var`.
    ```javascript
    var x = 5; // x starts off as a number
    x = "Hello"; // x now stores a string
    ```

    - JavaScript's **weak typing** leads to features that seem unintuitive for people coming from other languages.

        - For instance, `3 == "3"` returns `true`, even though you're comparing a number and a string. `3.0 == "3"` also returns a `true` because JavaScript only has one type for number.

            - If you want to check that two values are equal *and* their types match, you can use the `===` operator. `3 === "3"` returns `false`.

- JavaScript arrays work much like arrays work in other languages such as Java, with a few notable differences.

    - JavaScript arrays can store more than one type of element at any given time. `var myArray = [1, false, "Hello"];` is perfectly valid.

    - Array sizes are flexible. To add `"lemon"` to the end of the `fruits` array, use `fruits.push("lemon");`. Alternatively, we can use `fruits[n] = "lemon"` and, if `fruits` doesn't *have* an *n*<sup>th</sup> element, `"lemon"` will be inserted at index *n*.

- JavaScript *objects* are sets of key–value pairs which represent the object's *properties*.

    - Empty objects can be created using
    ```javascript
    var myObject = {};
    ```

    - You can also instantiate objects with properties using
        ```javascript
        var myObject{firstName:"Ben", lastName:"Myers", age:20};
        ```

        - This creates an object with the properties `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` set to `"Ben"`, `"Myers"`, and `20` respectively.

    - Alternatively, you can create objects using the `new` operator:
        ```javascript
        var myObject = new Object();
        ```

    - New properties can be added to objects at any time. For instance, the following code creates an empty object, gives it a `message` property, and then successfully outputs that `message` property to the browser console.
    ```javascript
    var myObject = {};
    myObject.message = "This is a message!";
    console.log(myObject.message);
    ```

    - Objects' properties can also be accessed using a notation resembling that of arrays. For instance, in the above example, we could replace every instance of `myObject.message` with `myObject["message"]`.

- JavaScript really puts the *fun* in *functions*. <sub>*Please don't hurt me.*</sub>

    - Declaring a function to get the area of a rectangle given the rectangle's width and height might look like
    ```javascript
    function getArea(width, height) {
        return width * height;
    }
    ```
    This function can then be called later using
    ```javascript
    var area = getArea(3, 5); // area now stores 15
    ```

    - The above is fairly normal for people used to Java-like languages. However, JavaScript also does some... unique... things with functions.

        1. **Functions can be stored in variables and passed around as parameters.** Relatedly, __functions can be *anonymous*__, meaning they aren't given a name.
            ```javascript
            // Storing a function in a variable
            // This function is anonymous - it has no name
            var area = function(width, height) {
                return width * height;
            };

            var size = area(3, 5); // size now stores 15
            ```

            ```javascript
            // Here, a function is saved as the behavior of the 'button' object upon being clicked
            button.onclick = function() {
                console.log("I've been clicked!");
            };
            ```

            ```javascript
            // This code snippet does the same as the above code snippet,
            // except by passing an anonymous function as a parameter
            button.addEventListener("click", function() {
                console.log("I've been clicked!")
            });
            ```

            - Anonymous functions are good in cases such as:

                - Code that only needs to run one time in a script

                - Event handlers and listeners

                - Avoiding conflicting function names between two scripts

        2. In languages like Java, code is generally expected to be fairly linear. The code on line one executes, then the code on line two executes, and so forth. JavaScript code, however, will often end up being very **asynchronous**. In the following example, the invented `drawPhoto()` and `manipulatePhoto()` functions are called but, because downloading photos may be a very slow process, there's no guarantee that the photo has been downloaded and stored in `photo` before `handlePhoto()` is called.
            ```javascript
            var photo = downloadPhoto("www.sample.com/test.jpg");
            handlePhoto(photo); // 'photo' may not be defined in time for this!
            ```

##### JavaScript – Practice

- Sample [FizzBuzz](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) implementation which prints each output on a new line
    ```javascript
    for(var i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
    {
        if(i % 15 == 0) // divisible by both 3 and 5
        {
            document.write("FizzBuzz<br>");
        }
        else if(i % 3 == 0) // divisible by 3, not 5
        {
            document.write("Fizz<br>");
        }
        else if (i % 5 == 0) // divisible by 5, not 3
        {
            document.write("Buzz<br>");
        }
        else // not divisible by 3 or 5
        {
            document.write(i + "<br>");
        }
    }
    ```

- Random color generator:

    - HTML:
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title></title>
                <script src="ColorGenerator.js"></script>
            </head>
            <body>
                <center>
                    <h1 id="hexCodeHeading">#ffffff</h1>
                    <button type="button" id="colorButton">Generate New Color!</button>
                <center>
            </body>
        </html>
        ```

    - JavaScript (`ColorGenerator.js`):
        ```javascript
        // Can't access anything like the button until we know the page has loaded
        window.onload = function() {
            // First, find and store the button using its 'id' tag
            var colorButton = document.getElementById("colorButton");

            // Let's also get access to the hex code heading
            var hexCodeHeading = document.getElementById("hexCodeHeading");

            // Give colorButton a clicking behavior
            colorButton.onclick = function() {

                // Generate new hex color
                var randomColor = generateColor();

                // Update the heading which shows the hex code
                hexCodeHeading.innerText = randomColor;

                // Set background color
                    // Notice that this targets the 'backgroundColor' attribute...
                    // of the CSS styling ('style')...
                    // of the body element of the document
                document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
            };
        };

        var hexDigits = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];

        // Generate a random hex color
        function generateColor()
        {
            var color = "#";
            for(var i = 0; i < 6; i++)
            {
                // Randomly choose which digit should be appended
                var digit = hexDigits[Math.round(Math.random() * 15)];

                // Append digit
                color += digit;
            }
            return color;
        }
        ```

##### jQuery – The Theory

- jQuery is not included in JavaScript by default – **you will need to import it before you can use it**. There are two ways you can do this:

    - **Download jQuery and host it yourself:** You can download jQuery from [jQuery.com](http://jquery.com/download/). jQuery.com allows you to install two versions of jQuery: the production version (which is minified and compressed) and the development version (which is spaced out and legible). You won't need to tinker with the jQuery code, so download the production version, `jquery-3.1.1.min.js`. Place it inside your webpage's directory. Link to the jQuery script using its relative path with the following element in the `<head>` section before any jQuery code is called:
        ```html
        <script src="jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
        ```

    - __Get jQuery from a *content delivery network (CDN)*: *(recommended)*__ Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery, and you can just link to them! This has the advantage of the jQuery file likely already being cached in your viewers' browsers, meaning your page loads more quickly. Copy one of the following code snippets into your `<head>` section before you call any jQuery code:
        ```html
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        ```
        ```html
        <script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
        ```

- **What is jQuery good for?** jQuery doesn't really let you do anything plain JavaScript wouldn't let you do. However, jQuery provides three main advantages: simple selectors, simplified code for common tasks, and cross-browser compatibility.
