# Art that uses Computers and Software

### On the name

What we will be talking about today is the use of computers and software to
help generate, or generate in its entirety, something that may be called "art".
There are many terms and names that can be used to describe this, an a few are
mentioned below.

	* generative art - can include non-computerized art as well
	* computer art - can be too vague, as using photoshop could fall into this
	  category
	* digital art - same problem as computer art
	* algorithmic art - focuses on the computer algorithms
	* procedural generation - the world "procedural generation" is usually used in the
	  context of video games, not usually "Art" - with a capital A
	* and more, I'm sure.

Note that all of these terms have their own *seperate* wikipedia entry, in that
they are all distinct.

### Some areas we will discuss

1. Fractals
1. General Algorithmic Art
	1. Procedural content in games
	1. Music
	1. Source Code as Art
1. Neural Network Algorithms
1. Miscellaneous cool stuff

### Fractals

* One of the first widely popular uses for algorithms to create truely stunning
  art
* There is an intense amount of math that can be used to describing fractals
	* Z = Z^2 + C is the formula for the *mandelbrot* fractal
	* contains infinite detail, and repeating "self-similar" structures, has a
	  "fractal dimension" 
	* *many* applications, and real world examples
* many different ways to *interpret* the formula as an image:
	1. [ three images of mandelbrot using different visualization algos ]



* Electric Sheep screensaver

### General Algorithmic Art

* L-systems
* ?
* ?

### Procedural content in games

* minecraft
* no mans sky
* diablo

* Creating terrain, maps/levels
* Generating new enemies, stats, weapons
* 

### Music

* procedurally generated music
