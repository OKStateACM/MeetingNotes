# Art that uses Computers and Software

### On the name

What we will be talking about today is the use of computers and software to
help generate, or generate in its entirety, something that may be called "art".
There are many terms and names that can be used to describe this, an a few are
mentioned below.

	* generative art - can include non-computerized art as well
	* computer art - can be too vague, as using photoshop could fall into this
	  category
	* digital art - same problem as computer art
	* algorithmic art - focuses on the computer algorithms
	* procedural generation - the world "procedural generation" is usually used in the
	  context of video games, not usually "Art" - with a capital A
	* and more, I'm sure.

Note that all of these terms have their own *seperate* wikipedia entry, in that
they are all distinct.

### Some areas we will discuss

1. Fractals
1. General Algorithmic Art
	1. Procedural content in games
	1. Music
	1. Source Code as Art
1. Neural Network Algorithms

### Fractals

* One of the first widely popular uses for algorithms to create really cool
  artwork
* There is an intense amount of math that is used to describing fractals
	* Z = Z^2 + C is the formula for the *mandelbrot* fractal
	* contains infinite detail, and repeating "self-similar" structures, has a
	  "fractal dimension" 
	* *many* applications, and real world examples
* many different ways to *interpret* the formula as an image:
	1. [ three images of mandelbrot using different visualization algos ]
	2. ![standard](http://www.eddaardvark.co.uk/python_patterns/images/w21.gif)
	3. ![star](http://www.eddaardvark.co.uk/python_patterns/images/w21s.gif)

	6. ![bands](http://www.eddaardvark.co.uk/python_patterns/images/b2.gif)
		* "In this scheme you keep iterating z until you reach a point (x+iy)
		  that has a modulus greater than 2 (x2 + y2 >  4). You then calculate
		  the arc tangent of y âˆ• x and use that as an index into the colour
		  map. The result is an image like the one on the left." [source

  algorithm for parameterized [flame fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_flame)

### Procedural content in games

* minecraft
* no mans sky
* diablo

* Creating terrain, maps/levels
* Generating new enemies, stats, weapons
* 

* L-Systems

### Music

* Using computers to generate new music, with or without any human intervening!
* ex) Markov Chains
	* analyse music and record statistical composition of notes
	* For instance, find the probability of the note A# following the note C
	* After all the probabilities are recorded, randomly sample a note, given
	  the probability distribution calculated earlier
	* So, if the last note was a C, there will be some probability that the
	  next letter will be an A#
	* can form larger probability distributions by thinking about more than the
	  last letter (for instance, given the last two, three, or four notes, etc)
	  but requires much more time and input to generate a good distribution
	* We can also use a NN to generate and sample in a similar manner using
	  LSTM networks
* Genetic algorithms, Generative Grammar systems (such as L-systems), Fractals,
  Artifical Intelligence, etc. can/are utilized
* For more, here's a cool summary paper: [http://peterlangston.com/Papers/amc.pdf]
  that describes in more detail 6 different methods in the literature.
* Quick note on factals, as described in the paper:
  Used to interpolate between notes based on a random brownian motion fractal

### Source Code Poetry

```
You will(Need no){ 
	Example at=ALL;
	if (You.are(GOOD))
		at.writing(Your.CODE);
}
```

* Famous Perl program [Black Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Perl)
* Ongoing competition at [http://sourcecodepoetry.com/]
* Aside from poetry, things like code golf, quines, and esolangs can be seen as
  art forms

```
